# STEGANOGRAPHY-BASED-EMAIL-OTP-VERIFICATION-SYSTEM
The idea of our project is to build a stronger and more modern OTP system that would replace the traditional OTP methodology. This is going to be achieved by the implementation of steganography into the existing system which definitely has multiple flaws and we aim to implement our understanding of the concepts to overcome a few of those.
